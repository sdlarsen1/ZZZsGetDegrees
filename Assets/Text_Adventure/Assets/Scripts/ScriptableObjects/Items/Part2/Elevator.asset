    textResponse: "You climb into the elevator, which is barely wide enough to hold
      you. The doors close, one after another, grinding to a mechanical halt. The
      elevator starts moving downwards, with sparks suddenly raining down on you from
      the light. Amidst a choking back smoke, the grinding begins to rise in pitch
      as the elevator begins to descend in a horrid mockery of modern transport. Everything
      begins to shake apart, the doors fly off their hinges. You dive through the
      first gap you can see, and... \n\nYou are back in the same hallway."
