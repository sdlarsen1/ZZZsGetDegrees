  description: "Labs like this one really make you feel like a scientist when you
    work in one. The counters and tables are lined with beakers and hooded chambers
    and all sorts of other sciency stuff that you don\u2019t actually use all to much
    but wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a CSI montage. There are a number of workstations
    here, including Workstation 14.\n"
