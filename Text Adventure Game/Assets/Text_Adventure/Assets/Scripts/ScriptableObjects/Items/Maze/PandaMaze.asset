    textResponse: "Hello again, friend!\n\nI see you\u2019ve completed the first challenge!
      I knew you would! Well, to be honest, you didn't have much of a choice. I hadn't
      come up with a backup plan in case you failed.\n\nAnyway, glad you made it.
      All in one piece, right? .... Ah, I forgot you can't talk.\n\nNow, to continue
      this journey of self discovery, I have brought you to ScioLie, a building that
      even I, with all my panda wisdom, have only ever successfully navigated once.
      I think.\n\nThe exit is right behind me, however it's locked. The only way through
      is to either change how the programmers coded the room, or to find and flip
      the three, and ONLY three, levers located throughout the building. Call it an
      exercise to practice your memorization skills. Or you can cheat and draw a map,
      but you'll only be cheating yourself. I think that's what I'm supposed to say.
      \n\nGood luck!"

      be shy.
