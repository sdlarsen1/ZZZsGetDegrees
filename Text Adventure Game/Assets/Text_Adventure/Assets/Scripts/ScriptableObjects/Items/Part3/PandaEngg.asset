    textResponse: 'Welcome to BTLC, the home of the beavers! As you explore the building,
      you''ll notice how how many rooms there are. This is to house their superiority
      complex.


      God, I hate beavers. My neighbour was a beaver and he stole my wife, but that''s
      not why you''re here. This is your final test! You must discover the three weaknesses
      of the beavers and use them against their leader, the Dean, in order to reclaim
      my glory! I mean your glory!


      By the way, stay out of the Civil slums. Those beavers tend to be extra... spicy.'
