    textResponse: "There is, and may always be, a hole in Workstation 14. Before switching
      majors you had taken a few entry level science courses and ended up having a
      chemistry lab. You assumed that the lab was like those you\u2019d taken in high
      school, were what the teachers said was a powerful acid barely amounted to a
      skin irritation. As it turns out the university has no issues giving chemicals
      to teenagers. Hence the hole you made."
