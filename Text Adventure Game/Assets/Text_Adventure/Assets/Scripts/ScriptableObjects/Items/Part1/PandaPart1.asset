    textResponse: "The panda speaks:\n\nHello, *waves* Now I know what you\u2019re
      wondering: Where am I? Where is everybody? Who are you?  Why can a panda talk?
      Why did you say \u201C*waves*\u201D out loud? How did you pronounce \u201C *
      \u201D?  Why can\u2019t I say anything? \r\n\r\nWell due to streamlined dialogue
      programming, I\u2019ll do all the talking here. \r\nNow to answer your other
      questions.\r\nYou are exactly where you left off, at the University of [redacted].
      You fell asleep, ya silly goose!\r\n\r\nSo now you\u2019re in a dream and I
      am here to help guide you with your inner demons, and faults, to solve for the
      true meaning of friendship.\r\n... wait there were supposed to be two of you\u2026\r\nto
      solve for the true meaning of being a 4.0 student.\r\n\r\nI am the magnificent
      panda, Express. The Spirit of Students past, present and future. Due to a pending
      lawsuit, and a cease and desist order, we had to combine into one spirit.\r\n\r\nYour
      task is to explore the campus to figure out the clues and puzzle on why you\u2019re
      here. Once you figure out all the puzzles, I am contractually obligated to let
      you wake up.\r\n\r\nNow, you might be wondering \u201CExpress, why can\u2019t
      I just wake up to continue my assignment?\u201D and I have a perfectly good
      answer: this dream is worth 40%. Now go!\r\n"

      and waves you over. Maybe Talk to it.
