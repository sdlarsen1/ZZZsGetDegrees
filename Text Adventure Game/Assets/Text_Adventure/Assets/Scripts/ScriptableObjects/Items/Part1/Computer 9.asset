    textResponse: "Oh jeez, this takes you back. Back in second year you came here
      all the time to do project work since this was one of the few labs on campus
      that didn\u2019t require you to login first. Because of this loophole you were
      able to use a bunch of third party programs to do most of the work for you,
      and that's not even including the times when you remotely accessed other machines.
      Just remembering those times makes you"
