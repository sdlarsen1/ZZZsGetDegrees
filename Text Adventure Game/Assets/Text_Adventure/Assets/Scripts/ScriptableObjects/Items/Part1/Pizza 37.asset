    textResponse: "Pizza 37: a great source of mediocre, overpriced \u201Cfood\u201D.
      You used to come here all the time in your first year, once even dropping an
      entire paycheque in a week because you didn\u2019t want to deal with one of
      the foreign food places. What a joke. You\u2019re smart enough now to mostly
      buy from Quick Panda Foods which has a better money to food ratio. With any
      luck you\u2019ve grown as a person since then, variety is the spice of life
      and all that."
